### 🔒 Security (BREAKING CHANGES)

This is a major security release that addresses multiple vulnerabilities reported by security researchers. **All users should upgrade immediately.**

#### Fixed Vulnerabilities

- **CRITICAL**: Fixed disabled Chromium sandbox vulnerability (CVE pending)
  - Chromium sandbox is now **enabled by default**
  - Users can still disable with `--no-sandbox` flag if needed (with security warnings)
  - This was the most severe vulnerability, allowing potential remote code execution

- **HIGH**: Eliminated code injection risk in executeJavaScript calls
  - Replaced all `executeJavaScript` with template literals with secure IPC communication
  - Implemented proper preload script with context isolation
  - All data passing through IPC is now validated and sanitized

- **MEDIUM**: Strengthened URL validation
  - Replaced string prefix checks with proper URL parsing
  - Protocol validation now uses URL constructor
  - Prevents bypass attempts with encoded URLs

### Added

- **SECURITY.md**: Comprehensive security policy and responsible disclosure guidelines
- **Preload script**: Secure IPC bridge between main and renderer processes
- **Security warnings**: Console warnings when running with reduced security
- **CSP implementation**: Content Security Policy enforcement
- **Input validation**: All external inputs are now sanitized

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Sandbox now enabled by default (may require system configuration)
- Refactored privacy toggle to use IPC instead of code injection
- Refactored badge generation to use IPC instead of code injection
- Improved URL opening handler with proper parsing
- Updated README with security information and troubleshooting
- Version bump to 2.0.0 to reflect breaking security changes

### Security Features

- ✅ Chromium sandbox enabled by default (critical fix!)
- ✅ Context isolation enabled
- ✅ Node integration disabled in renderer
- ✅ Secure IPC communication (no code injection)
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ Protocol validation for external URLs
- ✅ Preload script with proper isolation

### Migration Guide

Users upgrading from v1.x to v2.0.0:

1. **Recommended**: Configure your system for sandbox support
   ```bash
   echo "kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=0" | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/99-appimage.conf
   sudo sysctl --system
   ```

2. **Alternative**: Run with `--no-sandbox` flag (not recommended)
   ```bash
   ./WhatsApp-2.0.0.AppImage --no-sandbox
   ```
