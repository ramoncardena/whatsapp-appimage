**The ultimate unofficial WhatsApp Desktop client for Linux.** 

A privacy-focused, lightweight Electron wrapper packaged as a universal **AppImage**. Runs instantly on **Ubuntu**, **Debian**, **Fedora**, **Arch Linux**, **Linux Mint**, **Manjaro**, and more—no installation required. 

Includes essential features missing from the web version, like **System Tray support**, **Native Notifications**, and a unique **Privacy "Boss Mode"** to instantly blur your chats.

## Features

- 🚀 **Zero Install**: Just download (or build) the AppImage and run.
- 📱 **Native Experience**: Runs in its own window, separate from your browser tabs.
- � **System Tray**: Minimizes to tray to keep running in the background.
- 🕵️ **Privacy "Boss Mode"**: Instantly blur the screen with `Ctrl+Shift+B` (or `Cmd+Shift+B`).
- 🔒 **Secure**: Chromium sandbox enabled, context isolation, no Node integration in renderer.
- 🛡️ **Hardened**: Secure IPC communication, input validation, URL protocol checking.
- 🔧 **Customizable**: Open source, so you can tweak the Electron wrapper as needed.

## Security

This application takes security seriously. Version 2.0+ includes significant security improvements:

- ✅ **Chromium Sandbox Enabled** - Isolates browser process from system (critical fix!)
- ✅ **Context Isolation** - Separates preload scripts from web content
- ✅ **No Node Integration** - Prevents direct access to Node.js APIs from web content
- ✅ **Secure IPC Communication** - No code injection via executeJavaScript
- ✅ **Input Validation** - All external inputs are sanitized
- ✅ **URL Validation** - Proper protocol checking for external links

For security concerns or to report vulnerabilities, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Usage

### Running the AppImage

1.  Download the latest `.AppImage` from the [releases page](#) (or build it yourself).
2.  Make it executable:
    ```bash
    chmod +x WhatsApp-1.0.2.AppImage
    ```
3.  Run it:
    ```bash
    ./WhatsApp-1.2.0.AppImage
    ```

### Shortcuts & Tips

- **Privacy Blur**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+B` (or `Cmd+Shift+B` on Mac) to instantly blur/unblur the window. Great for privacy!
- **Minimize to Tray**: Closing the window will minimize it to the system tray. Right-click the tray icon to Quit completely.

### Troubleshooting: Sandbox Errors

**v2.0+ runs with the Chromium sandbox enabled by default for security.** This is the recommended and most secure way to run the application.

If you encounter an error like:
`The SUID sandbox helper binary was found, but is not configured correctly...`

This is common on newer Linux distributions (like Ubuntu 24.04+) that restrict unprivileged user namespaces. You have two options:

**Option A (RECOMMENDED): Enable unprivileged user namespaces**

This is the secure solution that keeps all security protections active:

```bash
# Temporary (until reboot):
sudo sysctl -w kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=0

# Permanent:
echo "kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=0" | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/99-appimage.conf
sudo sysctl --system
```

**Option B (NOT RECOMMENDED): Run with `--no-sandbox`**

⚠️ **Security Warning:** This significantly reduces security protections. Only use if you understand the risks.

```bash
./WhatsApp-2.0.0.AppImage --no-sandbox
```

When running without sandbox:
- Only use on trusted networks (no public WiFi)
- Keep your system fully updated
- Be aware this removes important security isolation

## Building from Source

Requirements: Node.js (v14+ recommended) and `npm`.

1.  Clone the repository:

    cd whatsapp-appimage
    ```

2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  Build the AppImage:
    ```bash
    npm run dist
    ```
    The output file will be in the `dist/` directory.

## Development

To run the app in development mode without building:

```bash
npm start
```
